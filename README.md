## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS Superset
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styles
- [Ipify Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/) - IP Address Lookup
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) - Interactive Map JS Library
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) - Map Tile Data

### What I learned

I learned a ton about working with APIs, chaining API calls that depend on data from the previous call, and securing API keys. I also gained valuable experience working with interactive maps and map tiles.

### Useful resources

- [IP Geolocation API Docs](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - Straightforward and easy documentation to begin making API calls quickly.
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - This made it much easier to work with Leaflet in a React component.
